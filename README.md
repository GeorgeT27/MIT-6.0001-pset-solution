# MIT-6.0001 pset solution
Here are my solutions to the problem sets in the 6.0001 course at MIT.

* You can find the full course by searching MIT online courses [6.0001](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-0001-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-in-python-fall-2016/).

* If you finished learning 6.0001, there is a more advanced course [6.0002](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-0002-introduction-to-computational-thinking-and-data-science-fall-2016/) and you can access my solution [here](https://github.com/GeorgeT27/MIT-6.0002-pset-solution.git).

I have tested all of the problem set,they should be right. However, there might be some small problems in the solution as I have just started learning Python. You are more than welcome to email me any thought or questions you have. My email is (tangqa26@gmail.com)
